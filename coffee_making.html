    <ol>
      <li><b>Heat up a cup of water.</b> To heat a cup of water quikly and easily, microwave it for 1 minute.You could also heat it on the stovetop using a pot or kettle.Heat it over medium-high heat, then take the water off of the stove just before it starts to boil.</li>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>For 1 serving, heat 1 cup(240mL) of water.Use more if you want to make additional servings.</li>
        <li>Using a kettle will make it easier to pour the hot water into your mug.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <li><b>Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of instant coffe to mug.</b> Check your instant coffee container's label to see how much you should use to get the best taste.Most companies recommend using 1 to 2 teaspoons for 1cup (240mL) OF water.</li>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Use more if you like stronger coffee</b> and less if you like weaker coffee.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <li><b>Dissolve the coffee with a tablespoon of cold water.</b>Mixing the coffee with a bit of cold water gently dissolves it.Gently dissolving the coffee instead of shocking it with hot water will improve the flavour.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Pour the hot water into the mug.</b>Add the water carefully, especially if you're not using a kettle.Remember to leave room for milk or creamer if you don't like your coffee black.</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Mix in sugar or spices, if desired.</b> For a richer coffee flavour, add sugar or spices after mixing the coffee with hot water.If you'd like, add a teaspoon of sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, or allspice.</li>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>You could also use a flavored coffee creamer. Keep in mind that <b>most flavoured coffee creamers are really sweet, so you probably won't need any extra sugar.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <li><b>Add milk or cream if you're not a fan of black coffee.</b> Spoon dairy milk, almond milk, or another non-diary option, cream, or flavoured creamer into your coffee.The right amount to use depends on how light or dark you like your coffee.</li>
      <br>
      <ul> <!--In between, I used this unordered list tag for deep explanation-->
        <li>You can also skip the milk or creamer and drink your instant coffee black.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <li><b>Stir your coffee and serve it.</b>Give the coffee a good stir before enjoying it or serving it to someone else.Mix it until it's uniform in color to evenly blend the milk and sugar(if you're using them).</li>
    </ol> <!-- It's the end for ordered list tag-->
